# DoseMap-calculator
Practical tool to obtain doses of a component travelling through a radiation field. The input data provided to the program has the form of a VTK file containing the dose map and a csv file containing the trajectory information (positions, velocities and waiting times). The tool provides visual representations of the data and generates a csv file with information of the dose received at each step of the trajectory. The tool has its own integrated GUI.
